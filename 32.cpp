/*
This C++ code demonstrates the concept of nested classes in Object Oriented Programming, where a class (Address in this case) is defined within another class (Person in this case).

In this code:

1. The `Person` class has a member `name` of type `string` and an object `addr` of the `Address` class, which is defined within the `Person` class.

2. The `Address` class has three members: `country`, `streetName`, and `houseNumber`.

3. The `AddressPlease` method in the `Person` class displays the name of the person and their address (country, street name, house number).

4. In the `main()` function, a `Person` object named `Alex` is created. The fields `name`, `country`, `streetName`, and `houseNumber` are set for the `Alex` object, and then `Alex.AddressPlease()` is called to print out these details.

5. Finally, an object `ad` of type `Person::Address` is created. This demonstrates that nested class types can be referred to outside of the containing class using the `OuterClass::InnerClass` syntax. However, the object `ad` is not used further in this code.

One of the uses of nested classes can be to encapsulate related types within a container type, providing scope and organization to the code. In this case, `Address` is related to `Person` and so is nested within it. This can also help to avoid naming conflicts with other code in larger projects.
